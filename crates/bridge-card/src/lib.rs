//! Convention card schema and `.bbsa` import.
//!
//! The card records partnership agreements ("we play Smolen", "1NT is 15-17"),
//! addressed by dotted paths such as `notrump.transfers.jacoby`. It does not
//! define what bids mean; that lives in the `conventions/` rule files.
//!
//! The fields a card can hold, and how BBA's `.bbsa` keys map onto them, are
//! the rules' [`Vocabulary`]: `card/fields.toml` and `card/bbsa-map.toml` in
//! the rules directory (`conventions/card/` here), loaded at run time. A
//! [`Card`] is a set of `path = value` pairs in one vocabulary, read from and
//! written to the nested JSON used by the Bridge-Classroom card editor.
//! See docs/DESIGN.md, "The convention card".
