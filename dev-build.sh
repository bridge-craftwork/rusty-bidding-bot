# dev-build.sh - run cargo against local sibling checkouts, reliably.
#
# Ported from bridge-rulebot (2026-09-30). Why this exists: this repo
# depends on sibling bridge crates as *git* dependencies (bridge-types,
# bridge-encodings, bridge-solver, and bridge-card from convention-card),
# with gitignored [patch] overrides in .cargo/config.toml redirecting them
# to local checkouts during development. That combination
# is a trap for bare cargo:
#
#   * When the local crate's version EQUALS the locked one, any resolving
#     cargo command (build/test/check/run) applies the patch immediately and
#     silently REWRITES Cargo.lock with local-path entries that must never
#     be committed (CI has no sibling checkouts).
#   * When the versions differ, the patch is silently IGNORED and you build
#     the GitHub revisions instead of your local edits.
#
# Either way bare cargo does the wrong thing, so always go through this
# script. It keeps two lockfiles and swaps them around the cargo call:
#
#   Cargo.lock       committed lock, pinned to git sources (CI truth)
#   .cargo/dev.lock  local-only lock, resolved with the patches applied
#
# and verifies every patched crate in the dependency graph actually resolved
# to a local path, failing loudly if not. The committed Cargo.lock is never
# touched.
#
# Config discovery: cargo merges .cargo/config.toml from every *ancestor* of
# the invocation directory, so the overrides that apply here are not
# necessarily next to this script. In a git worktree under
# .claude/worktrees/<name>/ there is no local .cargo/ at all, yet the main
# checkout's config three levels up still patches the build. Looking only
# beside the script made this script fall through to bare cargo in exactly
# that case — the one place bare cargo silently corrupts Cargo.lock, and with
# --ci not even reaching the guard that would have said so. So we walk up the
# way cargo does and manage whichever config we find. Lockfiles stay
# per-worktree (Cargo.lock is), while the config, and therefore the --ci
# move-aside, may be shared: don't run two --ci builds against the same
# config concurrently.
#
# Usage:
#   ./dev-build.sh                  # cargo build, against local checkouts
#   ./dev-build.sh test             # cargo test, against local checkouts
#   ./dev-build.sh build --release  # any cargo subcommand + args
#   ./dev-build.sh --ci test        # CI-parity: patches disabled, committed
#                                   # lock's git pins, lock rewrite guarded
